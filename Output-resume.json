My greatest achievement in this profession was the delivery of service with genuine respect and concern. As an effective member of a multidisciplinary team, I respected my co-workers and learned from their experiences as Alcoholism Counselors. I participated in individual and group counseling sessions. I referred clients to support groups that would be an asset in maintaining recovery and contacted various outside agencies to assist individuals with whatever support was needed. I monitored, evaluated, and recorded client progress with respect to their individualized treatment goals.",
